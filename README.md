# Supervised-Learing

I have created a model with supervised learning in which we have given a dataset of 25 students.
In the dataset number of hours a student studies and how much they score in exams are provided.
Dataset can be found at "http://bit.ly/w-data".

Steps to train a model:

- Firstly, import the libraries which we will be needed in this task i.e pandas, numpy, matlplot and sklearn
- Import the dataset in the module.
- Now, Plot the dataset on the graph so that we can find relation between the attributes.
- After plotting the dataset we can see that there is a linear relation between the attributes.
- So we will the dataset as input and output
- We will use train test split model from scikit learn to train and test the module.
- Import Linear Regression function which will be used to train the model as there is a linear relation.
- After this train the model with the train dataset.
- After training the model test it with train dataset and calculate the accuracy or error
- Now, We can use this model to predict the outcome with our own input.
